# LCM-GCD
The greatest common divisor (G.C.D) of two numbers is the largest positive factor that perfectly divides the two given numbers.
Factors of N:
• If a number N is divisible by X, then X is a factor of N.
■ Example:
If N = 15 and X = 3, then 3 is a factor of 15 as 15 is divisible by 3.
If N = 15 and X = 7, then 7 is not a factor of 15 as 15 is not divisible by 7.

• The least common multiple (L.C.M) of two numbers is the smallest positive factor that is perfectly divisible by the two given numbers.
• A multiple of a number is a number that is the product of a given number and some other number.
• Example: 7 X 2 = 14, 14 is a multiple of 7.
